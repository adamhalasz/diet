## v0.9.22** - 2015 October 24
- Body/footer separation in host.js for clarity

## v0.9.21** - 2015 October 24
- Don't JSON stringify `$.failure()` and `$.success()` responses because `$.end()` does it too

## v0.9.19 - v0.9.20** - 2015 October 23
- Fixed a https bug in host.js - if the port was undefined in the header it used 80. For https it should be 443. Now it's using the server's configuration to choose a default fallback protocol.

## v0.9.16 - **v0.9.18** - 2015 October
- Chainable Server Instance Creation, Listening and Routing. Now you can do stuff like:
```
server()
	.listen(8000)

	.get('/other', function($){ $.end('hello other world') });
	.missing(function($){ $.end('404 :)') });
```
- Fixed bugs with `$.end`

## v0.9.8 - **v0.9.16** - 2015 June - October
- `$.end()` now serves JSON responses on requests where the `"x-requested-with"` == `"XMLHttpRequest"` or the `"Authorization"` header is set and contains `"Bearer"` or `"Token"` in it's value
- `$.end()` now accepts JSON objects as a value and sends it as a JSON response
- app.html now enables $.html as the default response when using $.end
- Added `$.html()` - by default it just sets the content-header to html - to ovewrite it set a handler for `$.htmlModule (input)` in your diet header modules 
- Bug Fixes
- Added Unit Tests for the new `$.end()` function

## v0.9.7 - 2015 June
- Fixed a bug that didn't allow registering named addresses without a port

## v0.9.6 - 2015 June

- A server instance now has an options attribute `server(options)`
- Added `options.silent` to server options which if set to `true` disables all logs generated by diet for that Server Instance

## v0.9.4 - 2015 June
- Treat localhost addresses equally (127.0.0.1, 192.168.99.100, localhost)
- Listen on multiple addresses without redirects or host configs

## v0.9.3 - 2015 May
- The body for POST and PUT methods now require the appropriate "Content-Type" header to be parsed. For URL encoded body "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" is required, for JSON requests "application/json". If no "Content-Type" is specified then $.body contains the raw body content.

## v0.9.2 - 2015 February
- Support for `options`, `put`, `head`, `patch`, `trace` and `delete` HTTP methods
- Added `app.put`
- Added `app.head`
